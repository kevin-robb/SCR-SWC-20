# The SCR Software Challenge 2020

After the university went online in Spring 2020, members of Sooner Competitive Robotics' software team created this challenge to take the place of our cancelled competitions. Starting from a simple ROS template, each person created their own code base to localize a robot, determine a path to the goal through optional waypoints, and navigate this path while avoiding obstacles. This is all done using a custom simulator. This challenge roughly follows the premise & scoring guidelines of the RoboMagellan competition: [robogames.net/rules/magellan.php](http://robogames.net/rules/magellan.php).

The latest version of the simulator can be found at [github.com/SoonerRobotics/SCR-SWC-20/releases](https://github.com/SoonerRobotics/SCR-SWC-20/releases).

Please see the wiki at [github.com/SoonerRobotics/SCR-SWC-20/wiki](https://github.com/SoonerRobotics/SCR-SWC-20/wiki) for setup and documentation.
