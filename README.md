# The SCR Software Challenge 2020

Sooner Competitive Robotics' software members are competing for the lowest score in a programming challenge which uses a custom simulator roughly following the premise and scoring guidelines of the RoboMagellan competition: [robogames.net/rules/magellan.php](http://robogames.net/rules/magellan.php).

The latest version of the simulator can be found at [github.com/SoonerRobotics/SCR-SWC-20/releases](https://github.com/SoonerRobotics/SCR-SWC-20/releases).

Please see the wiki at [github.com/SoonerRobotics/SCR-SWC-20/wiki](https://github.com/SoonerRobotics/SCR-SWC-20/wiki) for setup and documentation.
